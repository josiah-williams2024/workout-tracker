# 🏋️ Workout Tracker

A personal learning project to build a **full-stack workout tracking app** that works on both web and mobile (PWA).  
This project grows over time as I learn new skills across frontend, backend, databases, and deployment.

## 📖 Features
- Add, edit, and delete workouts  
- Track progress by date and muscle group  
- Store data locally (initially via LocalStorage → later via database)  
- Responsive and installable as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**  
- Optional user login and progress history (future goal)

## 🧠 Learning Goals
1. **Frontend Development**
   - Build interfaces using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
   - Learn responsive design and UI structure  
2. **Backend Development**
   - Understand REST APIs and CRUD operations  
   - Build backend using **Node.js / Express** or **Python / Flask**
3. **Database Integration**
   - Learn basic database design (MongoDB / MySQL / Firebase)
   - Connect backend to persistent storage
4. **PWA Development**
   - Learn about service workers, caching, and offline functionality  
   - Make the app installable on phones
5. **Version Control & Deployment**
   - Practice Git & GitHub workflows  
   - Deploy using **GitHub Pages**, **Render**, or **Vercel**

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (frontend prototype)  
2. Add your first workout and save it  
3. Later, run the backend server for API-based storage  
4. Track your progress each week!
